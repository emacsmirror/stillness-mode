** stillness-mode

An emacs mode that stops windows from resizing when you complete something.
Inspired by Psionikus: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aA1wfW6t0g

*Installation*:

with straight.el:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(straight-use-package '(stillness-mode :host github :repo "neeasade/stillness-mode.el" :branch "main"))
#+end_src

*Features*:

- works with horizontally stacked windows
- accounts for windows below the expected minibuffer height
- keep your region if it would be visible

*Customization*

~stillness-mode~ should /just work/, but you can tell it the expected minibuffer
height by setting ~stillness-minibuffer-height~

*Caveats*:

- if you depend on the point /during/ a completing read, this breaks you (eg [[https://github.com/oantolin/embark][embark]])
